- ⚡ Fun fact: I walked away from a successful and lucrative past life in business operations. I taught myself some coding early on in my career so that I could automate processes and have more time to focus on bigger-picture problems. I grew a lot during this time and built cool programs and processes. Eventually, I noticed that I would feel more energized whenever I was leading projects that were more software engineering-focused than business or operations-focused. So, I decided to take a career break and transition into software engineering.
